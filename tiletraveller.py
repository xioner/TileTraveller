# The player enters:
# • n/N for north (up)
# • e/E for east (right)
# • s/S for south (down)
# • w/W for west (left)

# If the player enters an invalid direction, the program prints “Not a valid direction!” 
# and allows the player to enter the direction again.

# First check where the player is

# 1,1 = UP
# 1,2 = North/South/east
# 1,3 = South/east
# 2,1 = East
# 2,2 = West/South
# 2,1 = North
# 3,3 = West/South
# 3,2 = North/South
# 3,1 = Victory
